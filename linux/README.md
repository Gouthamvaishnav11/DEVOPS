# Linux & Internet Essentials â€” Complete README

This guide covers how the internet works, types of servers, differences between application and web servers, Linux basics, system management, and **clear, common commands for practical use**.

---

## How Does the Internet Work?

- The internet is a massive network of computers linked globally.
- Your device connects to an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
- Data travels as **packets** via routers to its target.
- **DNS** translates website names (like www.google.com) to IP addresses.
- The browser communicates with remote servers using protocols like **HTTP/HTTPS** and receives content.

---

## What is a Server?

- A **server** is a computer or software providing resources or services (web page, email, file) to other computers (clients) over a network.

## Web Server vs Application Server

| Web Server                   | Application Server                      |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Serves static content (HTML) | Runs code for dynamic content (e.g., Java, PHP) |
| Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests  | Handles business logic, connects to databases |
| Examples: Apache, NGINX      | Examples: Tomcat, JBoss, WebLogic       |

---

## Types of Applications

- **Standalone Apps:** Run on your computer with no need for the internet (e.g., VLC, MS Word).
- **Web Applications:** Accessible through your browser (e.g., Gmail).
- **Mobile Apps:** Designed for phones/tablets (e.g., WhatsApp).
- **Distributed Apps:** Work across a network of computers.

---

## What are Standalone Apps?

- Programs installed and run on a local device, independent of network connection.

---

## What are Web Applications?

- Apps that live on remote servers; accessed and used through your browser.

---

## Application Support & Maintenance

- **Support:** Help users, troubleshoot issues, apply quick fixes.
- **Maintenance:** Fix bugs, update features, maintain security.

---

## Linux Introduction

- **Linux** is a free, open-source operating system, popular for its security and flexibility.
- Used in servers, desktops, embedded systems.

---

## What is Linux? (OS Introduction)

- Linux is the core (kernel) + a set of tools (GNU utilities).
- Distributions: Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Arch, etc.

---

## Installing Linux

### WSL + Ubuntu (on Windows)

1. Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux via Windows Features.
2. Download "Ubuntu" from Microsoft Store.
3. Launch and set up username and password.

### On AWS EC2

1. Go to EC2 dashboard. Click "Launch Instance."
2. Select Ubuntu as the OS.
3. Set instance type, storage, security group (open SSH/22).
4. Download key pair.
5. Connect:  
   ```sh
   ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ubuntu@<instance-ip>
   ```

## Volume Management & AWS

- **Volume:** A logical storage device.
- **Physical Volume (PV):** Actual disk or partition.
- **Volume Group (VG):** Pool of PVs.
- **Logical Volume (LV):** Resizable "virtual" partitions from VGs.

### Managing Volumes

```sh
# Show disks/partitions
lsblk

# Create a physical volume
pvcreate /dev/xvdf

# Create volume group
vgcreate myvg /dev/xvdf

# Create logical volume
lvcreate -L 10G -n myvol myvg

# Format
mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvg/myvol

# Mount
mount /dev/myvg/myvol /mnt/myvol
```

### AWS EBS Steps

- Attach new EBS volume to EC2 in AWS Console.
- SSH to instance, use `lsblk` to confirm attachment.
- Use `fdisk`, `mkfs`, and `mount` as above.
