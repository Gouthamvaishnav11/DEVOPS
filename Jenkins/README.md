Jenkins 

Introduction to Jenkins
1.Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables the automation of software development processes. It provides a platform for building, testing,  and deploying applications in an efficient and automated manner. Jenkins is
widely used in the industry due to its flexibility, extensibility, and large community support. It supports various programming languages and integrates with popular tools and frameworks.

2.Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD): CI/CD is a software development practice that involves automating the process of integrating code changes, building applications, running tests, and deploying them to production. The
primary goals of CI/CD are to increase productivity, improve software quality, and enable rapid and frequent releases. Continuous Integration (CI) focuses on integrating code changes frequently, while Continuous Delivery (CD) ensures
that applications can be released at any time.

3.CI/CD Pipeline Overview: A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that code goes through from version control to production deployment. It consists of multiple stages, each representing a specific task or set of tasks. Common
stages include code compilation, unit testing, code analysis, artifact creation, and deployment. Jenkins allows you to define and manage these stages, ensuring that the entire process is automated, consistent, and reproducible.

## 📌 Jenkins Declarative Pipelines

### 🔹 Overview of Jenkins and CI/CD

* **Jenkins** is a popular open-source automation server used in **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**.
* It helps automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

---

### 🔹 What are Declarative Pipelines?

* **Declarative Pipelines** in Jenkins provide a **structured and simplified way** to define CI/CD workflows.
* They are written in a `Jenkinsfile` using a **Groovy-based syntax**.
* ✅ **Benefits:**

  * Better **readability**
  * Easier **maintainability**
  * More **reusable** compared to Scripted Pipelines

---

### 🔹 Key Concepts in Declarative Pipelines

#### 1. **Stages & Steps**

* **Stages**: Represent **logical divisions** of the pipeline (e.g., *Build*, *Test*, *Deploy*).
* **Steps**: Define **tasks inside a stage**, such as:

  * Code checkout
  * Compilation
  * Running tests
  * Deployment

#### Example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running unit tests...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to production...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

#### 2. **Agent**

* The **agent** block defines **where the pipeline or a specific stage should run**.
* It can be:

  * **`agent any`** → Runs on any available Jenkins node.
  * **`agent { label 'docker' }`** → Runs on a specific labeled node.
  * **`agent { docker { image 'maven:3.8.4' } }`** → Runs inside a Docker container.

✅ Agents give **control and flexibility** over execution environments.

---

### 🔹 Why Use Declarative Pipelines?

* Simple, human-readable syntax.
* Easier to maintain for large teams.
* Integrates well with version control (GitHub/GitLab).
* Reduces errors compared to ad-hoc freestyle jobs.

## 📌 Syntax and Configuration

### 🔹 Declarative Pipeline Syntax

Understanding the syntax used to define pipelines in Jenkins.

* **Pipeline block**: The root element of a declarative pipeline, which includes its sections (**agent, stages, steps, etc.**).
* **Variables & Logic**: You can define and use variables, loops, conditionals, and function calls within the pipeline script.
* **Configuration options**: Additional configuration such as tools, environment, triggers, and post actions.

---

### 🔹 Pipeline Script

Defining the pipeline stages, steps, and other configuration options using the script.

* **Stages**: Define logical divisions of the pipeline.
* **Steps**: Define the actual tasks using built-in and custom steps.
* **Usage**: Use the `stage` block to declare different pipeline phases.

---

## 📌 Building Blocks of Declarative Pipelines

### 1. **Steps**

* Overview of commonly used built-in steps for actions like code checkout, building, testing, and deployment.
* Examples of steps:

  * `git` → Clone repository
  * `sh` → Execute shell commands
  * `docker` → Work with Docker containers
  * `junit` → Publish test reports
  * `archiveArtifacts` → Archive build artifacts
  * `deploy` → Deployment steps

---

### 2. **Environment Variables**

* Used to **store and access information** throughout the pipeline.
* Define and use environment variables within the pipeline script.
* Common uses:

  * Store credentials (with Jenkins Credentials plugin)
  * Save build numbers
  * Reuse values across stages

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        APP_ENV = "production"
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Building in ${APP_ENV} mode"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 3. **Parameters**

* Define parameters to make pipelines **flexible and customizable**.
* Different types:

  * `string`
  * `booleanParam`
  * `choice`

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'BRANCH', defaultValue: 'main', description: 'Git branch to build')
        booleanParam(name: 'RUN_TESTS', defaultValue: true, description: 'Run test cases')
        choice(name: 'ENV', choices: ['dev', 'staging', 'prod'], description: 'Deployment environment')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Info') {
            steps {
                echo "Branch: ${params.BRANCH}, Run Tests: ${params.RUN_TESTS}, Env: ${params.ENV}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 4. **Post Actions**

* Configure **post-build actions** such as sending notifications or publishing reports.
* `post` block executes **after pipeline completion**.
* Actions include:

  * `always` → Always run after the pipeline
  * `success` → Only when pipeline succeeds
  * `failure` → Only when pipeline fails
  * `unstable` → Run if the pipeline is unstable
  * `cleanup` → Run at the end no matter what

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        success {
            echo 'Build succeeded ✅'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Build failed ❌'
        }
        always {
            echo 'This always runs'
        }
    }
}
```
